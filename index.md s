# Getting Started #

Welcome to Mojio! This page will help get you started so that you can quickly get on your way to developing Mojio connected car apps. If you already have a Mojio SDK installed, you can skip ahead to the _Tutorial_ page.

From here on, the instructions are a bit different depending on your choice of development environment. Mojio officially supports _iOS_, _Android_, _.Net_ and _JavaScript_ and has SDKs for each of these environments. If you do not use one of these environments, as long as your choice of development tools support open technologies such as _HTTPS_, _REST_ and _WebSockets_, you will be able to integrate with Mojio.

# Some Basic Ground Rules #

Mojio gives you access to a great deal of data about the driver and their vehicle. Our hope is that you will create apps and services to improve the end user experience. We ask that you respect the end user, their overall app experience, and safeguard their privacy.

Driving while distracted is now a leading cause of accidents. We are building the connected car to improve the overall user experience. Please do so with safety in mind. Unlike other apps, Mojio apps know when the driver is behind the wheel. Please take extra care in ensuring that you do not distract the user when their focus should be on the road.

Finally, we want to help you build great apps. Our success is dependent on it. If there is anything we can do to make it easier to build car connected apps, please reach out to the Mojio team.

In summary:

- Respect user privacy.
- Consider driver safety when designing your apps.
- Provide a great end user experience.
- Build great car connected apps!
